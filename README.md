# KeyValueProject

if you want a file to create a file manually. Then follow below instruction.
while executing the code please specify the file path with \\\\.
while specifying the path don't mention the file name the code will automatically append the file name which is asked while starting the program


fileName: example.txt

filePath F:\\\\Folder

the code will automatically append the filePath + "\\" + fileName

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We can also use default file path if you want to use default filePath then mention that in console while asking.

Thank you.
